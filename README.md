Initially I have deployed it in AWS, but after they charge me 50$ a month with their free tier plan, I feel 
offended of them, so now you can just download and run it locally. 
You must have MYSQL 8 and maven installed on your machine. If you want to run this project locally, you have to change two environment variables in application.properties file - Cloudinary Api Secret and Database Password . I have made a data.sql file populated with all you need, so you can just
enjoy my work. 

In a nutshell this is Spring MVC application with a few libraries and techniques 
used in it such as Spring security, Thymeleaf as a template engine, interceptors, 
custom error handling and validators (such as Passay), Rest and Spring controllers.

This app was created just for a practice purpose.
